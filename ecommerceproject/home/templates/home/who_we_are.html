<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: justify;" valign="top">Tina, born and raised in Carazo, Nicaragua, has been living in Potrero for the past seven years. She is a strong, smart woman who has had a long relationship with Abriendo Mentes from sewing with MAP to taking English classes and participating in zumba. Since she joined in 2012, Tina’s favorite part of MAP has been the occasional trips to craft fairs to sell their products and see what others are making. She says the excursions give her a chance to visit other towns&nbsp;and get new project ideas, which makes her proud of MAP’s work. A mother of four children and a grandmother of one, Tina spends her days working hard cleaning private homes to help her family back in Nicaragua. In her spare time, Tina enjoys sewing, dancing and watching TV.</td>
<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: justify;" valign="top">Yorleny is a sweet and gentle addition to the group, whose curiosity and love of learning have allowed her to try new designs and grow her technical skills. What she finds most fun about being a part of MAP is meeting new people such as AM volunteers, learning from them, and teaching them a thing or two as well. Yorleny is creative and enjoys making new bags; yoga bags and kite surf bags being her favorite. Her daughter Verenice was one of the first English students to attend classes with Abriendo Mentes, and her family has actively helped to grow the organization. Her family rents apartments and provides homestays to AM volunteers and her husband serves on the Costa Rican Board of Directors. &nbsp;As a mother of two young children, she’s devoted to taking care of her family, her home, and occasionally cleans private homes. She enjoys gardening, playing with her kids, dancing, sewing and enjoying the peace and quiet of Potrero.</td>

<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: justify;" valign="top">Gladys, who has been a part of the sewing group since the beginning, has always brought a vibrant light to the advanced group. She is always eager to share her years of sewing experience and socialize with the group. She is a hardworking woman who always shows up at The SHOP with a big smile despite her long days as a single mother of eight children. Born and raised in the south of Costa Rica, Gladys has lived in Potrero since 2009. What she enjoys most about MAP and sewing is seeing her creativity come to life, learning new patterns, and being part of a supportive group. &nbsp;In the little spare time she has, Gladys enjoys going for walks, taking care of her chickens, and going to church.</td>
<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: justify;" valign="top">Damaris is a strong and steady participant in the group. A very creative and technically skilled seamstress, sewing at MAP also provides a nice break after a long day on her feet taking care of the chickens, pigs, horses and dogs at her family farm where she runs a horse tour business. She enjoys spending time with the other women, sewing, teaching the beginner class and finding moments that help her relax. Born and raised in Potrero and a mother of three, she enjoys spending time with the women in her family and gets much joy out of helping her daughter take care of her first grandchild.</td>
