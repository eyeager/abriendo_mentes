	<p> <b>MUJERES ACTIVAS DE POTRERO (MAP)</b> is a social enterprise program established by Abriendo Mentes in 2011 that enhances the lives of the local women in Potrero, Guanacaste, Costa Rica through:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>economic empowerment</b>: increasing women’s abilities to financially support themselves and their families</li>
		<li><b>education</b>: providing skills training to further professional development</li>
		<li><b>social empowerment</b>: enhancing women’s sense of self-confidence while providing a community platform for social engagement and collaboration</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4><span>MAP History</span></h4>
	<p> Mujeres Activas de Potrero (MAP) started in 2011 when a local woman approached two Abriendo Mentes volunteers, asking if they could provide an opportunity for local women to gather and spend time together to learn arts and crafts. Quickly, this casual weekly meeting grew into a more structured program including crafts classes and health and wellness workshops. Other past programming has included yoga, dance, cooking demonstrations and empowerment workshops. In May of 2012, a short-term volunteer taught a women’s sewing workshop, and our sewing social enterprise program was born. At the end of 2012, the success of MAP merited opening a second office to provide the women with their own workshop space. In October 2013, the workshop space (which had also served as an informal store) moved upstairs in the office and The SHOP opened, providing an attractive and inviting storefront next to the Abriendo Mentes office to showcase all of the wonderful MAP products. At the same time, other local artists were invited to participate in the store and sell jewelry, paintings, and other hand-made items. Today, MAP is focused on enhancing the sustainability and effectiveness of its programming as well as expanding to meet more of the local community’s needs.

	<h4><span>MAP Programming</span></h4>
	<p> Current MAP participants take part in our social enterprise project and affiliated sewing group, where advanced seamstresses meet three times a week to sew, improve their skills, and work together collaboratively as a team. Additionally, this advanced group empowers other local women by teaching a weekly beginners’ sewing class. This is an opportunity for the women to share other lessons they’ve learned through MAP, build relationships, and simply spend time together working on an art they all enjoy. Abriendo Mentes provides the following resources and tools to the sewing program:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>space, materials, and equipment to create handbags and other sewing products</li>
		<li>marketing resources to enhance earning potential and access different consumer bases</li>
		<li>a platform for women to assume leadership roles, learn new skills, and engage in fun, hands-on activities</li>
		<li>a coordinator to manage the project</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4><span>The Shop</span></h4>
	<p> The SHOP is MAP’s social enterprise that supports the economic empowerment of women by selling items sewn by participants of MAP and pieces made by other local artists. This social enterprise is a vehicle to enhance the livelihoods, life skills and relationships of the women of Potrero. Items that the women sew include bags, purses, backpacks, aprons, passport covers, wallets and more. Each and every item has a unique design and is handcrafted by a local woman from Potrero. All of the revenue from sales is either reinvested into the project or paid out to the women, increasing their monthly income and helping them to further provide for their families.</p>
	
	<p><strong>SUSTAINABLE AND ECO-FRIENDLY MATERIALS</strong></p>
	<p>The majority of the fabrics and materials used for this program have been donated to us and range from recycled curtains to old t-shirts to retired kite surf sails. Using these kinds of materials helps us maintain low costs and also helps the environment.</p>
